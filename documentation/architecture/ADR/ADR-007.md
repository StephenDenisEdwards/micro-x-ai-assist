# **ADR-007: Exclude Direct Integration with Meeting Applications**

**Date:** 2025-11-04

**Status:** *Accepted*

**Context Owner:** Stephen Edwards

**Related Use Case:** “AI Interview Coach – Audio Monitoring of Remote Interviewers”

---

## **1. Context**

The product must capture and analyze the *remote interviewer(s)’* speech during live online meetings, in order to provide real-time coaching or assistance to the interviewee.

Initial exploration considered direct integration with major meeting platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, and Google Meet using their respective SDKs or APIs (e.g., Microsoft Graph Real-Time Media, Zoom SDK, Google Meet APIs).

While technically feasible, this approach introduces significant complexity and cost, and is unnecessary given the functional requirement: simply to obtain the same audio that the local user already hears.

---

## **2. Decision**

We will **not implement direct integration** with any specific meeting or conferencing platform.

Instead, the system will rely on **operating-system–level audio capture** (loopback or virtual device) to access the mixed remote audio stream played through the user’s speakers.

This approach is  **application-agnostic** , functioning identically regardless of whether the meeting is hosted in Teams, Zoom, Meet, Webex, or other platforms.

## **3. Rationale**

| Consideration                                 | Analysis                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Integration Complexity**              | Each platform requires its own SDK or Graph-based bot registration, authentication flow, and media negotiation (SIP/WebRTC). Supporting multiple providers would multiply development and maintenance overhead.              |
| **Permission & Authorization Overhead** | Enterprise platforms (esp. Teams) require tenant admin consent, Azure AD app registrations, and explicit user authorizations for media access. These processes are inconsistent and often blocked in corporate environments. |
| **Licensing & Cost**                    | Several platforms impose API usage costs or premium tiers for real-time media access. Implementing equivalent functionality across vendors would be financially unjustifiable for early product iterations.                  |
| **User Experience**                     | Direct integrations typically manifest as visible bots or meeting participants, making setup and usage cumbersome. A purely local solution requires no user re-authentication and runs transparently once installed.         |
| **Maintainability**                     | Platform APIs evolve frequently; non-integrated OS-level capture is stable across versions. Maintenance risk is therefore lower.                                                                                             |
| **Cross-Platform Compatibility**        | Loopback/virtual-device capture is consistent across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Integrations would demand different SDKs per OS.                                                                                             |
| **Data Privacy / Control**              | Local capture ensures all processing remains on the user’s device. No audio streams are transmitted to third-party APIs without explicit configuration, simplifying GDPR compliance.                                        |

## **4. Consequences**

### **Positive**

* Greatly simplified implementation: single code path per OS.
* Works across all major conferencing tools without modification.
* Lower cost, faster time to market.
* Stronger data-privacy stance (local processing possible).

### **Negative**

* Only one mixed remote audio channel (no per-speaker separation).
* Cannot leverage meeting metadata (participant names, timestamps, chat events).
* Requires user-level routing setup (virtual device / output configuration).
* Still subject to lawful disclosure obligations when processing others’ speech.

---

## **5. Alternatives Considered**

1. **Full Teams Integration via Microsoft Graph Real-Time Media SDK**
   * *Rejected* : high setup complexity, visible bot presence, ongoing maintenance cost.
2. **Zoom SDK with Embedded Media Streams**
   * *Rejected* : limited OS support, expensive licensing, same consent problems.
3. **Browser Extension for WebRTC Interception**
   * *Rejected* : brittle, browser-dependent, easily broken by platform updates.
4. **Local OS Loopback Capture (Chosen)**
   * *Accepted* : minimal setup, robust, platform-independent.

---

## **6. Implementation Notes**

* **Windows:** use WASAPI loopback to capture the render device assigned to the meeting app.
* **macOS:** use a virtual audio device (BlackHole/Loopback) approved in System Settings.
* **Linux:** use PulseAudio/PipeWire monitor sources.
* **No integration hooks** with Teams/Zoom APIs are to be introduced.

---

## **7. Compliance and Governance**

* Although technically local, the solution may still process identifiable speech.

  ➜ Ensure visible status indicator and user disclosure toggle.
* Avoid data persistence unless explicitly configured by the user.
* Include optional configuration templates for organizations requiring consent management.
