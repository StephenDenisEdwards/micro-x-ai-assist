# Un-detected question samples

List phrases the hybrid detector currently fails to classify as questions/imperatives. Use to improve detection logic or add fallback rules.

Examples (add more as you discover misses):
- "Wondering if we should restart the service"
- "Maybe check the logs?"
- "Not sure what caused that spike"
- "Would be good to verify the backup"

(Keep each on a separate line prefixed with `-`.)
